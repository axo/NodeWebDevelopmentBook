This book, Node Web Development, focuses on building web applications using Node. 
We will be taking a tour through the important concepts required to speed up with Node. 
To do so we'll be writing real applications, dissecting them to scrutinize how they work, 
and discussing how to apply the ideas to your own programs. We'll install Node and npm, 
and learn how to install or develop npm packages and Node modules. We'll develop several 
applications, ponder the effects of long-running calculations on event loop responsiveness, 
look at a couple of ways to distribute heavy workloads to other servers, 
work with the Express framework, and more.
